In WebLogic Server, Admin Mode and Suspend Mode are operational states that you can place a server into for maintenance or administrative purposes. Each mode serves different functions and is used in different scenarios. Here's an explanation of both modes:
Admin Mode

Admin Mode is a server state where the server is started but not available for normal application traffic. Instead, it is available only for administrative operations and maintenance tasks. In Admin Mode:

    Deployment and Configuration Changes:
        Administrators can deploy or undeploy applications, and make configuration changes without affecting the users.

    Limited Access:
        Only users with administrative privileges can access the server. Regular users cannot access the applications deployed on the server.

    Diagnostic and Maintenance Tasks:
        Ideal for performing diagnostic and maintenance tasks such as testing configuration changes, upgrading applications, or troubleshooting issues without affecting the production environment.

    Application Lifecycle Management:
        Applications can be deployed in an administration mode where they are active but not serving requests. This allows administrators to configure or test applications before making them available to users.

How to Enter Admin Mode

You can start a server in Admin Mode using the command line or through the WebLogic Administration Console.

Using Command Line:

sh

java -Dweblogic.management.startupMode=ADMIN -Dweblogic.Name=ServerName -Dweblogic.Domain=DomainName weblogic.Server

Using WLST:

python

start('ServerName', 'Server', block='true', startMode='admin')

sh

java -Dweblogic.management.startupMode=ADMIN -Dweblogic.Name=ServerName -Dweblogic.Domain=DomainName weblogic.Server

Using WLST:

python

start('ServerName', 'Server', block='true', startMode='admin')

Suspend Mode

Suspend Mode is used to temporarily halt server operations while still keeping the server running. This is typically used for controlled shutdowns or to gracefully remove a server from a cluster for maintenance. In Suspend Mode:

    Graceful Shutdown:
        The server stops accepting new requests but continues to process in-flight requests. This ensures that ongoing transactions are completed without abrupt interruption.

    Administrative Tasks:
        The server remains running and can be managed by administrators. Once all requests are processed, the server can be shut down or restarted.

    Health Checks and Maintenance:
        Useful for performing health checks or maintenance tasks that require no new requests to be processed but do not necessitate a complete server shutdown.

    Cluster Management:
        When part of a cluster, Suspend Mode allows you to safely remove a server from the cluster, perform the necessary tasks, and then bring it back online without disrupting the entire cluster.

How to Enter Suspend Mode

You can suspend a server using the WebLogic Administration Console or WLST.

Using the WebLogic Administration Console:

    Go to Environment -> Servers.
    Select the server you want to suspend.
    In the Control tab, click on Suspend and confirm the action.

Using WLST:

python

connect('admin_username', 'admin_password', 't3://admin_server_host:admin_server_port')
edit()
startEdit()
shutdown('ManagedServerName', 'Server', ignoreSessions='true', force='false')
save()
activate()
disconnect()

Summary

Admin Mode: The server is started and available only for administrative tasks, not for serving applicatio
n traffic. Useful for deployments, configurations, and diagnostics.

uspend Mode: The server stops accepting new requests but continues processing ongoing requests. 
Ideal for performing maintenance tasks without shutting down the server completely.
